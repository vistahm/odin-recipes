    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a 
        usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based 
        dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often 
        various other ingredients, which is then baked at 
        a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
