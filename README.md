It was an introduction to HTML language and learning the basics of it.
Here are the following things that I've learned recently in Odin Project:
- HTLM Boilerplates (DOCTYPE, html, head and body tags)
- HTLM attributes
- Comments in HTML
- 'a' tag; 'href' and 'rel' attributes
- Absolute and relative links
- 'img' tag; 'src' and 'alt' attributes
